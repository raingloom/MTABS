caching:
	checksums: source, prep + prepa, luac alphabetically ordered
	checksum algorithm: md5 would be faster and we don't need cryptographic security
	hierarchy:
		<source>
			<prep + prepa>
				<luac>
necessary ACL:
	need to stop and start resources (background daemon functionality)
	need to create/modify files and file names
